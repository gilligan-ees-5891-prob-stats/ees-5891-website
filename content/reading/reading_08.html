<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<p>This very short chapter goes over guidance on style for naming variables
and functions and formatting your code to make it easy to read and keep
it organized.</p>

<div id="chapter-5" class="section level2">
<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
<p>This chapter introduces principles of tidy data and tools in R for
organizing your data into tidy formats.</p>
<div id="principles-of-tidy-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Principles of Tidy Data</h3>
<p>The fundamental idea is that there are many ways to organize a data set
in a table with rows and columns. Different kinds of analysis call for
different ways of organizing your data. However, for all these ways
of organizing, there is an overarching principle, illustrated in the
figure below:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Each variable is a column and each column is a variable</li>
<li>Each observation is a row, and each row is an observation</li>
<li>Each value is a cell and each cell is a value</li>
</ol>

<div id="pivoting-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Pivoting Data</h3>
<p>The chapter has two principle parts, each of which focuses on a
different aspect of <em>pivoting</em> data by rearranging rows and columns.</p>
<div id="lengthening-data" class="section level4">
<h4>Lengthening Data</h4>
<p>The first part looks at tools for <em>lengthening</em> data by combining many
columns into a single column and adding another column to indicate what
each row signifies.</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="_images/column-names.png" alt="Pivoting to lengthen a data frame by combining two columns into one" />
<div class="figcaption">Pivoting to lengthen a data frame by combining two columns into one</div>
</div>
<p>The key thing to pay attention to in this reading is the
<code>pivot_longer()</code> function. The <code>distinct()</code> function is also important,
because it helps us eliminate redundant rows.</p>
<p>Focus on sections 5.3.1 and 5.3.2.</p>
<p>Section 5.3.3 gets into fancier ways to lengthen data, which you will
probably not need, so you can skim this section lightly.</p>
<p>However, do pay enough attention to section 5.3.3 that you will know
what is possible and can return to it later if you’re reading in
complicated data and need the more powerful tools to organize it.</p>
</div>
<div id="widening-data" class="section level4">
<h4>Widening Data</h4>
<p>The second part looks at tools for <em>widening</em> data by splitting up
one column into multiple columns. <em>Widening</em> is much simpler than
<em>lengthening</em> data, so this section is shorter. The key thing here
is to become familiar with the <code>pivot_wider()</code> function.</p>
