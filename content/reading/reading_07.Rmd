## Reading:

### Required Reading (everyone):

* R for Data Science, Ch. 2--3.

### Reading Notes:

## Overview of the reading

* See the homework assignment for the exercises you whould do.

### Chapter 2

This very short chapter goes over the basics of coding in R.
It discusses creating variables to store data or other information,
and calling functions to transform data.


### Chapter 3

This chapter is longer and gets into how we organize data in R.
There are many ways to organize and work with data, and for this
book and this course, we will follow Hadley Wickham's principles
of tidy data. The principles of tidy data are explained in section 5.2,
which we will read 
for
Thu., Jan. 30.

This chapter focuses on the `dplyr` package, which is part of the 
larger `tidyverse` package.

The `dplyr` package (pronounced "Dee-Plier", like "pliers") defines a 
data structure called a `tibble` (which stands for "Tidy Table"), and
a suite of functions for transforming `tibble`s.
A `tibble` is a variation on an R `data.frame`, and you can mostly 
consider the two to be the same.

In a `tibble`, each row represents a different measurement or observation,
and it contains columns, which represent the different variables you 
record for each observation:

The `dplyr` package defines many functions to manipulate and transform
`tibble`s. The most important for this chapter are:
* `filter` to create a new `tibble` by choosing certain rows that match
  conditions given in `filter`.
* `arrange` to rearrange a tibble by putting the rows in order of 
  different columns, from smallest to largest or largest to smallest.
* `select` to create a new `tibble` by selecting a subset of the 
  columns, and optionally renaming and re-ordering them.
* `rename` and `rerlocate` can change the names of columns or the order
  of columns in the table.
* `mutate` to change the values of certain columns or create new columns.
  You can use other columns to set the value of the new column to things
  like the sum, difference, product, ratio, or other functions of other 
  columns.
* The pipe `|>` lets you easily connect multiple functions to create
  a new `tibble` from a combination of these functions.
* `group_by` and `ungroup` let you perform operations on groups of
  rows in a `tibble`. For instance, if a `tibble` contains measurements
  of rocks retrieved from five different sites, you can use `group_by`
  to report the average silica content of rocks at each site.
* `summarize` lets you generate summary statistics, such as mean, 
   median, standard deviation, maximum, or minimum, for selected 
   columns.
* `slice` functions let you select certain rows from a `tibble`, such
  as the 5 rows with the greatest values for a certain column.
  
There is a lot more to `dplyr`, but this will get us started.
