<h3>Reading Notes:</h3>
<p>The key reading for today is the handout, “Introduiction to Reproducible
Research,” which introduces the concepts behind reproducible research
and presents historical examples and context for the motivations and
goals behind the growing adoption of reproducible research practices.</p>
<p>You should read this handout first.</p>
<p>The other major readings are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Introduction to Git and GitHub Classroom,” which explains the <code>git</code>
revision control system and the way we use it with GitHub and GitHub
Classroom, for homework assignments in this course.</p></li>
<li><p>Chapter 28 of _R for Data Science,” which explains the Quarto system
for integrating text, data, and R code to create fully reproducible
research reports, manuscripts, web pages, blogs, etc.</p>
<p>Tools like Quarto are important because they let you recreate an entire
document—even an entire book—with the push of a button, and
automatically update it if data or analysis code changes.</p>
<p>The optional readings are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A short paper that appeared in the journal <em>Nature</em> describing how
badly many cancer research projects went wrong because they failed
to follow reproducible research methods. The paper argues that
“There are no more excuses for non-reproducible research methods.”</li>
<li>If you want to learn more about using Quarto, the website for the
Quarto project has extensive documentation.</li>
