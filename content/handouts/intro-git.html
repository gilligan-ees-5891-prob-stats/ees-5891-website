<h1>Revision Control for Reproducible Research</h1>
<p>A very important part of reproducible research is using revision
control.</p>
<p>For an excellent introduction to using git with R, I recommend
Professor Jenny Bryan’s web book, “Happy Git and GitHub for the useR”
at <a href="http://happygitwithr.com/" class="uri">http://happygitwithr.com/</a>.</p>
<div id="tools-for-revision-control" class="section level2">
<h2>Tools for Revision Control</h2>
<p>This document describes two related tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Git is a program that helps you manage revisions in files that you
edit (computer code, text documents, etc.), and coordinate sharing
documents and working on them with other people.</li>
<li>GitHub is a web site that allows people to share projects using Git.
It is free for educational users and for open-source projects that
anyone can see and copy. GitHub also allows paying customers to have
private projects.
Educational users can set up private projects for free.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="installing-git-on-your-own-computer" class="section level1">
<h1>Installing Git on Your own Computer</h1>
<p>There are three good options for git that work</p>
<ul>
<li>If your computer is a Mac or runs Linux, Git may already be installed.
You can check by opening a terminal window and typing <code>which git</code>.
If the computer responds with something like <code>/usr/bin/git</code>, then Git
is already installed. Otherwise, follow the instructions below.</li>
<li>For Windows and MacOS, you can download Git from
<a href="https://git-scm.com/" class="uri">https://git-scm.com/</a> and install it on your computer.</li>
<li>For Linux computers, you can install Git from a terminal window as
follows:
<ul>
<li>For Debian or Ubuntu, <code>sudo apt-get install git</code></li>
<li>For Fedora or other RedHat-type distributions,
<code>sudo yum install git</code> or <code>sudo dnf install git</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>After you install Git, it is important to run two commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Open a git command window:</p>
<ul>
<li>On Windows, open the Start menu, go to “Git” and click on “Git Bash”</li>
<li>On a Mac, open a terminal window</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Run the two following commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git config --global user.name "Your Name"</code> (using your own name
instead of “Your Name”)</li>
<li><code>git config --global user.email "your.email.address@vanderbilt.edu"</code>
(using your own email address)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Git uses information to keep track of who makes changes to a file. If
you are editing a file on your computer and a friend is editing it on
her computer, git uses this user information to keep track of who made
each change. Then when you and your friend merge your changes, git will
be able to tell you which of you edited what.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-git-does" class="section level1">
<h1>What Git Does</h1>
<p>Git is a very powerful tool that can do many things, and some of the
very advanced can become confusing, even to experts. Fortunately, we
can ignore most of what git can do, and focus on a few simple things:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cloning</strong> a project from a remote server (e.g., github.com) to make
a local copy of the file repository.</li>
<li>Using <strong>file differencing</strong> to see what you changed since the last
time you committed changes to your local repository.</li>
<li><strong>Staging</strong> and <strong>committing</strong> to record changes that you made to your
project in the local file repository on your computer.</li>
<li><strong>Synchronizing</strong> repositories on multip[e computers:
<strong>Pushing</strong> changes from your local computer and a remote
server and <strong>pulling</strong> changes from a remote computer to your local
computer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pretty much everything you might want to do with git, you can do from
inside RStudio.</p>
<div id="git-vocabulary" class="section level2">
<h2>Git Vocabulary:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Repository:</strong> A repository is where git stores the history of an
entire project. Git tracks every change that you make to every file
in a project.</p>
<p>Git can synchronize repositories in different computers. We will use
GitHub a lot for the homework assignments in this course.
When you start a homework project, you will use RStudio to create a
new project on your computer based on an assignment repository on
GitHub.</p>
<p>If you are collaborating with other people, you can both edit files
and then synchronize your repository with your partner’s repository
and this will let each of you see all of the changes that each of you
made to the files.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Clone:</strong> When you start a new homeowkr project in R, you will
<em>clone</em> a template that I post on GitHub classroom. Cloning a project
not only gives you a copy of the current project, but it also gives
you a copy of the entire history of the project, so if you are
working with a partner and one of you clones a project from the other,
you will be able to use Git to coordinate your work and
each of you will be able to see everything the other one has done on
the project. It is like “track changes” on steroids.</p>
<p>An easy way to clone remote repositories from RStudio is to go to the
“File” menu and choose “New Project”.
Then choose the option, “Version Control”. Then select “Git” and
enter the URL for the remote repository.
I walked you through this in class on Jan.~14.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, RStudio tells git to <em>clone</em> the remote repository,
which makes a copy of that repository on your local computer.
After you have cloned a repository, you will have not only the
current version of all the files in the project, but you will have the
entire history of each of those files.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Commit:</strong> A commit is a snapshot of all the files in a repository at
some point in time. If you edit some files, create some new files, and
delete some files, then you can commit all of those changes (edits,
new files, and deleted files).</p>
<p>The git repository will add the new files to the repository, note that
the deleted files have been deleted, and note the changes in the
edited files between the latest version in the repository and the
edited version that you are committing. Then it will then note the
current state of all the files in the repository, so the commit
represents a snapshot of the current state of all the files in the
repository when you make the commit.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Staging:</strong> Because a commit records a snapshot of the state of
your entire project, it often involves multiple files.
Before you <em>commit</em>, you need to <em>stage</em> the files you want included
in the commit.</p>
<p>Because a git commit records changes, you don’t need to worry about
staging files that have not changed, but for files that have
changed, you need to stage each changed file that you want included
in the commit.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this is in the Git pane in RStudio, which
shows a list of all the changed files. You can then check the
box next to each file you want to commit. You can also do this in
the window that you open with the “Diff” or “Commit” buttons in
the Git pane.</p>
<p>To commit, you choose one or more files to stage, write a comment
describing the changes your commit is recording, and press the
Commit button.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="using-git-with-rstudio" class="section level2">
<h2>Using Git with RStudio</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>File Differencing</strong> When you are working in an RStudio project that
has a git repository, if you edit a file, RStudio notices that it has
changed and the file appears in the “Git” window in RStudio. If you
highlight that file in the “Git” window and click on the “Diff”
button, RStudio will open a window that shows you what changed in the
file since, compared to the latest version in the repository.</p>
<p>RStudio shows the changes by identifying which lines in the file have
changed, and showing the old version of those lines in red, and the
new version in green. If you delete a line, you will just see a red
line, and if you add a new line, you will just see a green line.</p>
<p>If you decide that you are not happy with the changes and want to
restore the file to the version that existed in the repository, you
can right click on the file and select “Revert.”
Be careful with this, because
<strong>if you revert a file, you will lose <em>all</em> the changes you made!</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Staging and Committing Changes</strong> is where you tell git to save the
changes that you made to your local files into your local repository.
Git will only record changes in files when you commit changes.
Committing is a two-step process:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First, you <strong>stage</strong> the files you want to commit. When you stage
files, you tell <code>git</code> which of the changed files you want to include
in the commit.</p></li>
<li><p>Second, after you have staged one or more changed files, you tell
<code>git</code> to commit the changes on those files to the repository. This
makes a permanent record of all the changes in the staged files
between the previous commit and this commit.</p>
<p>In RStudio, any file you change will show up in the “Git” pane.
Changes can be editing a file, creating a new file, deleting a file,
or renaming a file.
You stage a file by checking the box next to the file name in the
“Git” window in RStudio. Then you tell git to permanently remember
those changes by Committing: Click on the “Commit” button in the
“Git” window.</p>
<p>Committing stores changes. If you delete a file, and then stage and
commit it, the repository will note that the file is now deleted.
However, all of the previous versions of the file, before you
committed the delete, will be stored in the repository. This is very
useful. If you have ever been working on a project and accidentally
deleted an important file, that can be very painful. With git,
<strong>if you committed that file to the repository, then even if you
delete the file and commit the delete, you will be able to recover
the file by checking a previous version out of the repository.</strong></p>
<p>Note that the repository <strong>only remembers the changes that you tell
it to commit.</strong> Specifically, it records the differences between
the last version of the file that you committed and the new version
that you are committing. It does not know anything about anything
that happened between the two commits. Thus, if you edit a file but
do not commit it, and then delete the file and commit the file as a
deleted file, git will only record the fact that you deleted the
file. It will not remember any edits that you made before you
deleted it.</p>
<p>It is a good idea to commit changes pretty frequently. Any time you
hve something that is working, it’s a good idea to commit. For
instance, if you are working on a project that has many parts to
it, as soon as you have answered one part you should stage and
commit the changes. That way, if something goes wrong, you can
recover your work from the repository.</p>
<p>When you commit changes to a repository, git asks you to enter a
comment to describe the commit. You can give a brief description of
what you changed in the commit, or remark on the state of the files
(e.g., “Answered exercises 1-5.” or “Finally, the scripts are
working properly!”). Think about what would be useful to you in
helping you understand the commit if you are looking back over your
repository history at some time in the future.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Synchronizing Repositories</strong>
Git can synchronize multiple repositories. You can <strong>push</strong> the
changes you have made on your local repository to a remote repository
on a server, or you can <strong>pull</strong> changes in the remote repository to
your local computer and merge them into your local repository.</p>
<p>When you work on your computer, all the work you do on your project
is stored on the local git repository on your computer. You turn in
your homework by pushing your local repository to the remote
repository at GitHub. Only after you have pushed your work will I be
able to see what you have done.</p>
<p>This is also relevant to asking for help. If you push your work to
GitHub, then I can clone it to my computer and take a look at your
code and offer comments or suggestions.</p>
<p>This may seem complicated, but you can simplify it if you follow a
basic practice:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Every time you start working on a project that has a remote
repository, <strong>pull</strong> from the remote repository before you start
working.</p></li>
<li><p>Every time you have committed work that you don’t want to lose,
<strong>push</strong> to the remote repository.</p>
<p>This also means that <strong>if you push projects from your personal
computer to a remote repository (e.g., on GitHub), then even if
your personal computer breaks or gets stolen, the remote GitHub
repository will have the whole history of the project, up through
the last time you pushed it.</strong></p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<div id="conflicts" class="section level3">
<h3>Conflicts</h3>
<p>If you edit the same file on two different computers, git will attempt
to merge the two sets of edits automatically. Git does a good job with
this if you edit different lines on the two computers. However, if you
edit the same lines on the two computers, git doesn’t know which
version of the changed lines you want to keep.</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>If you try to merge these, git can deal with the edits to the first and
third lines, but the two computers made incompatible edits to the second
line and git does not know whether to go with “clouds” or “milk”.</p>
<p>When you pull the changes from one computer onto the other, git will
complain about a conflict, and the file will look like</p>
<pre><code>Mary had a great big lamb
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
Its fleece was white as clouds
=======
Its fleece was white as milk
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; change
And everywhere that Mary walked
The lamb was sure to go</code></pre>
<p>Then you have to manually edit the file to resolve the conflict.</p>
<p>If you have conflicts, you will need to edit the files to resolve the
conflicts and delete the lines git uses to mark conflicts
(the ones beginning with <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</code>, <code>=======</code>, and <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>).
Then you will need to stage the files where you resolved the changes
and make a commit.</p>

<h1>GitHub and GitHub Classroom</h1>
<p>GitHub is a web site devoted to sharing open-source Git repositories and
allowing paying customers to operate private git repositories.
You can get a free account at <a href="https://github.com" class="uri">https://github.com</a> and as a student,
you can get some free extra features if you request a student account at
<a href="https://education.github.com/students" class="uri">https://education.github.com/students</a>.</p>
<p>GitHub classroom is an add-on service that GitHub offers for teachers,
which allows teachers to post assignments on GitHub and then invite
students to clone the assignment and then turn in the completed
assignment via a private repository.</p>
<p>For each homework assignment, I will create a repository on
GitHub Classroom and invite you to accept the assignment by posting an
URL on the assignment page on the class website.
When you accept the assignment, GitHub will clone the assignment into
private repository just for you on GitHub. Only you and I will be able
to see your private repository.</p>
<p>You can then clone the private repository to your personal computer and
complete it. As you make commits, I encourage you to push the changes
back up to GitHub.</p>
