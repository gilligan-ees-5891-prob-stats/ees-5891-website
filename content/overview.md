## Catalog Description {#catalog-desc}

**EES 4891/5891-01 **
Fundamentals of probability and statistics for the Earth & Envirommental 
Sciences, with applications in R. Probability distributions, descriptive 
statistics, statistical testing, regression analysis, elements of time-series 
analysis and multivariate statistics, principal components analysis, 
reproducible research methods, principles of statistical computing using R. 

### Prerequisites {#prereqs}

You should be comfortable with differential calculus and linear algebra.
I will review basic concepts, but the course will be difficult for you if you
are completely unfamiliar with these areas of math.

This course will be mathematical and will make extensive use of the R
software system, but I do not assume that you already know R or advanced 
mathematics beyond calculus and linear algebra.

## Goals for the Course {#goals}

By the end of the semester, you will:

* Understand theories of probability and be familiar with the properties of
  discrete and continuous probability distributions
* Understand what the Normal probability distribution is, and why it plays
  a central role in probability and statistics
* Understand how to perform descriptive statistical analyses of data
* How to use statistical tests to test propositions about data, such as 
  identifying differences between data collected from different sources.
* How to estimate the parameters of probability distributions from observed
  data.
* How to analyze time-series data.
* How to analyze sets of multiple variables, such as measurements of multiple
  elements or isotopes from each of a number of samples.
* How to organize any data analysis project using Reproducible Research 
  methods. Increasingly, journals and funding agencies require researchers to
  use reproducible research methods, so that other people can easily review
  and understand how the analysis was conducted, and so that if questions arise,
  even years later, it will be possible to go back and understand exactly how
  the analysis was conducted.

## Reading Material {#reading}

There are two required textbooks:

### Textbooks

1. {{% LONG_JEG %}}

   This will be the main textbook for most of the semester. The book is
   published open-access and you can download the PDF for free from 
   <{{% JEG_URL %}}>, Brightspace, or this website, at
   [{{% absolute_url "/files/course_files/DataAnalysisEarthEnvironmentalSci_2023.pdf" %}}](/files/course_files/DataAnalysisEarthEnvironmentalSci_2023.pdf "Download the textbook")


2. {{% LONG_R4DS %}}

   This book is the best practical introduction I have found for getting started
   with R and getting things done in data analysis. The author is the chief data
   scientist as the Posit company and wrote a huge number of widely used free
   packages to extend and enrich R. This book follows his philosophy of how to 
   organize data sensibly for analyzing and presenting it.
   
   You can buy a paper copy, if you wish, but the full text is available for
   free online at [{{% R4DS_URL %}}]({{% R4DS_URL %}} "Free online version of R for Data Science")

## Class Web Site

In addition to {{% BRIGHTSPACE %}}, I have set up a companion web site for this
course at
<https://ees5891.jgilligan.org>,
where I post the reading and homework assignments,
my slides from class, and other useful material. That web site will be the
central place to keep up with material for the course during the semester.
This web site will direct you to Brightspace if there is anything you need to
find there.

## Computer Software {#software}

For this class, we will work in R, and I strongly recommend that you install
the free version of RStudio Desktop for working with R. All the software we will
use this semester is free and can be downloaded and installed on Windows,
Mac, and Linux systems. You can find details at the 
[tools page]({{% TOOLS_PAGE_URL %}}) of the course web site at
{{% CLASS_WEB_SITE %}}

We will also use the {{% GIT %}} revision control software as part of our
Reproducible Research practice. You will use this to manage files
for assignments and the semester research project.
I will spend a class explaining why we use {{% GIT %}}, and how
to use it effectively for your homework and other projects.

# **Assignments** {#assignments}
 
### Overview of reading assignments {#reading-asgts}

I will post detailed reading assignments to the course website
{{% CLASS_WEB_SITE %}} 
that give specific pages to read for each class 
and notes on important things you should understand.
**I expect you to complete the reading before you come to class on the day 
for which the reading is assigned**, 
so you can participate in discussions of the 
assigned material and ask questions if there are things you don't understand.

## **Graded Work** {#graded-work}

### Homework {#homework}

Homework assignments will be posted on the course web site, and must be 
submitted by the beginning of class on the day it's due.

You will submit your homework to {{% BRIGHTSPACE %}} or {{% GITHUB %}}
as indicated on the assignment.

### Project {#project}

In the second half of the semester, you will do a research project, in which you
will choose a data set that's interesting to you and apply statistical methods to 
analyze it. You will present the results of your project in class during the
last week of the semester and turn in a written report about your project.

You may examine data from a research project you're working on, or it can be data
from a public data source that you are interested in understanding better.

### Tests and Examinations {#tests}

There will not be any tests or examinations in this course. Your grade will be 
based on class participation, homework, modeling projects, and in-class 
presentations.

## **Basis for Grading** {#grades}

|                            |       |      |
|:--------------------------:|------:|-----:|
| Class participation        |  5%   |      |
| Homework                   | 45%   |      |
| Research Project           | 50%   |      |


# **Final Note:**

This is the first time I have taught this course, and during the term, I will
assess how things are going, and may change the assignments and sequence of 
readings to help you get the most out of it.
