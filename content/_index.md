## Overview


## Text

There are two required textbooks:

### Required: 

* {{%LONG_JEG%}}
  is the primary text for this course. 
  
  This is an open-access textbook, which you can download from 
  <{{%JEG_URL%}}>, Brighspace, or the class website
  <{{%VU_JEG_URL%}}>.

* Hadley Wickham, Mine \cCetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund, 
  _R for Data Science_, 2^nd^ Edition (O'Reilly, 2023).
  You can read the entire book free at <https://r4ds.hadley.nz>


### Recommended (optional):

* Paul E. Smaldino, _Modeling Social Behavcior: Mathematical and Agent-Based Models of Social Dynamics and Cultural Evolution_
  (Princeton University Press, 2023).
  
  This book is optional. Nothing we will do this semester requires this book.
  It is especially recommended for graduate students and students who are interested in applying agent-based modeling to 
  social science and social systems. The book may be especially useful for finding interesting models to work with for 
  your semester research project.
