<h1>Semester Project Assignment</h1>
<div id="overview" class="section level2">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>You will investigate a data set of your choice. The project will involve
several steps, and will culminate in a written report, produced using
R and Quarto (if you strongly prefer to use a different set of tools,
that is fine. Python can work with Quarto too, and will allow you to
continue to use RStudio to develop your project.)</p>
<p>You will use R to import data, analyze it, and answer some questions
about it.</p>
</div>
<div id="details" class="section level2">
<h2>Details</h2>
<div id="choosing-a-data-set" class="section level3">
<h3>Choosing a data set</h3>
<p>You can use data from any source. This could be
research data from a project you have worked on or are working on,
or it could be a publicly available set of data from some other source,
such as the US Geological Survey, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, NASA, etc. It does not need to be geological or
environmental data.</p>
</div>
<div id="major-parts-of-the-project" class="section level3">
<h3>Major Parts of the Project:</h3>
<p>The project will include the following parts:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Importing the data into R, and converting it into one or more
<code>data.frame</code>s, <code>tibble</code>s, or other data structures.</p></li>
<li><p>Study the descriptive statistics of your data and identify possible
probability distributions you think it may have come from.</p>
<ul>
<li>Report the mean and standard deviation of each variable
in your data (e.g., temperature, rainfall, isotopic compositions,
mineral content, etc.).</li>
<li>Plot the distribution of each variable using histograms and
kernel density estimates.</li>
<li>Using common probability distribution functions that we have studied,
determine whether any of them seems to describe the data well.
Q-Q plots will probably be helpful to you.</li>
<li>If you are interested in relationships between different variables
in a multivariate data set, report correlations and optionally
produce a correlation plot.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Come up with some questions you want to ask about the data.</p>
<p>This could
be whether data from one set of observations is different from another
(e.g., the in-class exercise about whether droughts were different in
the Little Ice Age and the Mediaval Warm Period).</p>
<p>Another kind of
question is whether there is a relationship between two or more
variables in a multivariate data set (e.g., analyze correlations and
perform regression analysis).</p>
<p>A different kind of question would be
to apply principal components analysis (PCA) to a multivariate data
set and then use either regression or cluster analysis to the result
to identify interesting patterns or relationships in the data.</p>
<p>These
are examples, and you should feel free to discuss your data with me,
by email or in my office hours, as you explore it, graph it, and
think about what could be cool to do with it.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be overly ambitious.</strong> This is a one-semester class. Don’t make
your statistical questions too complicated. The point is to practice
using some of the techniques we’ve learned. Keep your questions at
a level where you can answer them in a week or two.</p></li>
<li><p>Using the basic logic of hypothesis testing, choose appropriate
statistical tests and use them to help answer the questions you
came up with in step (3).</p></li>
<li><p>Write a report about your data, how you analyzed it, and what you
learned.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You should use the features of Quarto to include figures and tables,
and use R to insert numbers into the text as necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>You can use author-date format for citing publications, or if you’re
adventurous you can use Quarto’s tools for automatically managing
citations and references (see <a href="https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto.html#visual-editor" class="uri">https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto.html#visual-editor</a>
for an example)</p></li>
<li><p>You will turn in your final report by rendering the Quarto
document to HTML, PDF, or Word format and pushing it to GitHub.</p>
<ul>
<li>I will create a template for you on GitHub Classroom.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>There isn’t a definite length for the report. I expect that
the report will be somewhere in the range of 10–20 pages, but
if you put a lot of figures and tables into your report, it could
go longer.</p>
<p>I will not grade on length, but on how clearly you present your
work (writing, clear use of graphics, etc.), finding interesting
questions to ask and interesting things to say about your data,
and effectively using the statistical methods we have studied,
which are appropriate to your questions.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div id="timeline" class="section level2">
<h2>Timeline:</h2>
<ul>
<li>By <strong>Thursday March 27</strong>, submit a short description of the data set
you want to work with for your project. This is not a formal thing,
like a paper, but send me a page or two telling me what the data
set is (what kind of data it has, where the data comes from,
what variables are measured, roughly how big the data set is (how many
rows of data in a spreadsheet or a similar measure of how many
observations it includes))
<ul>
<li><p>I expect that the specific research quesitons you will be asking
will develop as you play with the data, but for this initial assignment,
give me an idea of what kinds of questions you might want to ask about
this data.</p></li>
<li><p>I encourage you to come to my office hours or send me email to ask
questions or discuss what you are interested in and what you might
want to do with data.</p>
<p>It’s fine to say, “Here’s the kind of thing I’m interested in. Can you
help me find a good data set to work with?” or “Here’s a data set I’m
interested in. Can you help me come up with some good questions to ask
about it, using statistics?”</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The final project is due <strong>Tuesday April 22</strong> before midnight.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="resources-for-finding-environmental-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Resources for finding environmental data</h2>
<ul>
<li>A primary source of data on the world climate is the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which has a
Climate Data Online page (<a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/" class="uri">https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/</a>)
that can help you identify and download data.
<ul>
<li>There is also a more general Data Access page
(<a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/search/index" class="uri">https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/search/index</a>) that can help you
explore even more data sets.</li>
<li>If you’re interested in data on hurricanes, there is a page on
hurricane data sets at <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/" class="uri">https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/</a> and the
“Best Track” (HURDAT2) data set, which lists data on the full
track of each named tropical storm from 1851–2023 may be especially
rich. If you want to dig into hurricane data, I would also recommend
the book, <em>Hurricane Climatology</em> by James B. Elsner and Thomas H.
Jagger (Oxford University Press, 2013), which includes R code for
all sorts of statistical analysis of hurricanes. You can access this
book online through the VU libraries.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Records of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
can be downloaded from the Scripps CO<sub>2</sub> Program at Scripps Institution
of Oceanography at <a href="https://scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/" class="uri">https://scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/</a>. Measurements include
measurements of multiple gases taken at sites around the world, going
back as far as 1958. Some data also has been merged with records from
glacial ice cores to estimate CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations going back thousands
of years. Some data also includes analysis of different isotopes
of carbon and oxygen in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, which can give evidence for
the source (biological versus volcanic) and age
(e.g., burning wood versus fossil fuels) responsible for the changing
CO<sub>2</sub> concentration of the atmosphere.</li>
<li>The U.S. Geological Survey collects all sorts of great geological data,
which you can access through its data portal <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/tools/geo-data-portal" class="uri">https://www.usgs.gov/tools/geo-data-portal</a>.
The USGS also actively develops many tools for analyzing geological and
hydrological data in R, including the <code>dataRetrieval</code> package, which
lets you automate retrieving data using R.
USGS also has a searchable catalog of all its data products at
<a href="https://www.usgs.gov/products/data/all-data" class="uri">https://www.usgs.gov/products/data/all-data</a></li>
<li>NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information
<a href="https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/" class="uri">https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/</a>
also hosts
data on natural hazards <a href="https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazard/hazards.shtml" class="uri">https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazard/hazards.shtml</a>,
including volcanoes, earthquakes, wildfires, tsunamis, and storms.</li>
<li>The Smithsonian Institution’s Volcanos of the World databases
<a href="https://volcano.si.edu/gvp_votw.cfm" class="uri">https://volcano.si.edu/gvp_votw.cfm</a> includes an extensive collection
of volcanic activity spanning the entire Holocene.</li>
<li>Columbia University has built an extensive archive of climate data of
all sorts at the International Research Institute for Climate and
Society/Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (IRI/LDEO) Climate Data Library
<a href="https://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/index.html?Set-Language=en" class="uri">https://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/index.html?Set-Language=en</a></li>
<li>The R Open Science project has produced hundreds of R packages for
acquiring and analyzing all sorts of scientific data. It is worth
browsing or searching their list of data access packages for
downloading sicentific
data from public sources on the web <a href="https://ropensci.org/packages/data-access/" class="uri">https://ropensci.org/packages/data-access/</a></li>
