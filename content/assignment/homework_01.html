<h1>Install Software on Your Computer</h1>
<div id="install-r" class="section level2">
<h2>Install R</h2>
<ul>
<li>Download and install R
<ul>
<li><strong>Windows:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Download and install the <a href="https://cran.rstudio.org/bin/windows/base/" title="Download R for Windows">“base distribution” of R 4.4.2</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>MacOS:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Download and install <a href="https://cran.rstudio.org/bin/macosx/" title="Download R for MacOS">R version 4.4.2</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Linux:</strong>
<ul>
<li>You should be able to install R from your Linux distribution’s package manager:
<ul>
<li><code>sudo apt-get install r-base r-base-dev</code> for Debian or Ubuntu</li>
<li><code>sudo yum install R</code> or <code>sudo dnf install git</code> for Fedora,
Red Hat, and related distributions.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="install-git" class="section level2">
<h2>Install <code>git</code></h2>
<ul>
<li>If your computer is a Mac or runs Linux, Git may already be installed. You can check
by opening a terminal window and typing <code>which git</code>. If the computer responds with something
like <code>/usr/bin/git</code>, then Git is already installed. Otherwise, follow the instructions below.</li>
<li>For Windows and MacOS, you can download Git from <a href="https://git-scm.com/" class="uri">https://git-scm.com/</a> and install it on your computer.</li>
<li>If you use a software installation system like chocolatey (on Windows) or homebrew (on Mac), you can install <code>git</code>
by opening a terminal window and typing “<code>choco install git</code>” or “<code>brew install git</code>”</li>
<li>For Linux computers, you can install Git from a terminal window as follows:
<ul>
<li>For Debian or Ubuntu, <code>sudo apt-get install git</code></li>
<li>For Fedora or other RedHat-type distributions, <code>sudo yum install git</code> or <code>sudo dnf install git</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>After you install Git, it is important to run two commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Open a git command window:</p>
<ul>
<li>On Windows, open the Start menu, go to “Git” and click on “Git Bash”</li>
<li>On a Mac, open a terminal window</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Run the two following commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git config --global user.name "Your Name"</code> (using your own name instead of “Your Name”)</li>
<li><code>git config --global user.email "your.email.address@vanderbilt.edu"</code> (using your own email address)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Git uses information to keep track of who makes changes to a file. If you are editing a file on your
computer and a friend is editing it on her computer, git uses this user information to keep track of
who made each change. Then when you and your friend merge your changes, git will be able to tell you
which of you edited what.</p>
</div>
<div id="install-rstudio" class="section level2">
<h2>Install RStudio</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Go to the download page for the free desktop edition of {{&lt; RSTUDIO &gt;}} at
<a href="https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/" title="Download RStudio">https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/</a> and
download the installer for your operating system. Windows, MacOS,
and several editions of Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, RedHat, and openSUSE) are supported.</p>
<p>There are other versions of {{&lt; RSTUDIO &gt;}} (an expensive professional edition and a server edition). You
want the <strong>free desktop edition</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Run the installer.</p></li>
<li><p>After the installer finishes running, run {{&lt; RSTUDIO &gt;}}.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When {{&lt; RSTUDIO &gt;}} starts up, the lower left part of the screen should have
a window that displays the R version, saying something like this:</p>

<p>The details will be different depending on your operating system, but
if you see something like this, {{&lt; RSTUDIO &gt;}} correctly found R on your
computer.</p></li>
<li><p>Open the “Tools” menu, and click on the “Global Options” choice.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the “Git/SVN” tab and click “enable version control interface
for {{&lt; RSTUDIO &gt;}} projects”. If {{&lt; RSTUDIO &gt;}} can find the git program on your
computer, it will appear in the “git executable” field. If {{&lt; RSTUDIO &gt;}}
can’t find it, you can help it by browsing to the git program.</li>
<li>If you have installed {{&lt; LATEX_LOGO &gt;}} on your computer (remember that this is
optional), click on the SWeave tab, and select “knitr” for weaving
<code>.Rnw</code> files, and choose <code>pdfLaTeX</code> for typesetting {{&lt; LATEX_LOGO &gt;}} files into
PDF.</li>

<h1>Sign up for a free GitHub account</h1>
<pre><code>**Before class on Tuesday Jan 14** please sign up for a free account on GitHub at &lt;https://github.com&gt;. I also recommend that after you sign up, you then request a student account 
at &lt;https://education.github.com/students&gt;. A student account gives you access to a bunch of free extras, such as the ability to set up private projects on GitHub.

We will use an educational feature of GitHub called GitHub Classroom to distribute the lab assignments and for you to turn them in when you have completed them.</code></pre>
