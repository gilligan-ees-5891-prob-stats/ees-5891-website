on the button that says “Outline” on the top right of the editor window
with your <code>hw-02.qmd</code> document. Clicking on the section titles will
jump to that part of the document.</p>
<p>When you’re done, do the following steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

for answering the exercises.</li>
